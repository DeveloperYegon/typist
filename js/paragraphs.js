    "After risks have been identified the next step is risk analysis. Through risk analysis, we transform therisks that were identified into decision-making information. Each risk is considered and a judgment made about the likelihood and consequences of these risks. The probability may be very low, low, moderate,high or very high. Risk consequences might be catastrophic, serious, tolerable or insignificant.Determining the probability and the magnitude of the risk can be difficult and can seem to be arbitrarily chosen. One means of determining the risk probability is for each team member to estimate each of thesevalues individually. Then, the input of individual team members is collected in a round robin fashion and reported to the group. The team then sorts the risk list so that the high probability, high impact risks     percolate to the top of the table and the low-probability, low impact risks drop to the bottom",
    "During monitoring we assess each identified risks regularly to decide whether or not it is becoming less or more probable. Also assess whether the effects of the risk have changed. Each key risk should be discussed at management progress meetings. It is essential that the team regularly monitor the progress of the product and the resolution of the risk items, taking corrective action when necessary. This monitoring can be done as part of the team project management activities or through explicit risk management activities.",
    "The way that a group is organized affects the decisions that are made by that group, the ways that information is exchanged and the interactions between the development group and external    project stakeholders. Small software engineering groups are usually organised informally    without a rigid structure. For larger projects, there may be a hierarchical structure where different groups are responsible for different sub-projects. Agile development is based around an informal group on the principle that formal structure inhibits information exchange. For informal group the group acts as a whole and comes to a consensus on decisions affecting the system. The group leader serves as the external interface of the group but does not allocate specific work items.Instead, work is discussed by the group as a whole and tasks are allocated according to ability and experience. This approach is successful for groups where all members are experienced and competent.",
    "The team should be composed of members who share the same motivation. However this can be    problematic. An effective group has a balance of all types. This can be difficult to achieve    software engineers are often task-oriented. Interaction-oriented people are very important as they can detect and defuse tensions that arise."
